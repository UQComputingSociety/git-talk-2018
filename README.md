How to Git Gud with Neil

These are the slides of the git talk I gave for UQCS earlier in semester.
It took me a while to put them online, sorry.

They're generated using LaTeX, and beamer.
To view the slides as a pdf, just install LaTeX and run `pdflatex talk.tex` once or twice (so that it generates the contents slides correctly).
Also attached are the commits that I made during the live demos at the end of the talk.

Currently the slides are in a state where they aren't super useful as a resource without someone (me) talking around them.
I plan to, in the near future, fix this and turn them into a standalone resource.
Hopefully I'll also make the source code readable (sorry).
When that happens, you'll see it in this repo.

Cheers,
Neil
